      <p>
        My introduction to software development came as a byproduct of my 
        passion for video games as a child. It was a goal of mine to learn 
        how the games that I was sinking all of my time into were created. 
        I was (and still am) fascinated by the ability to create something 
        cool out of nothing other than time spent tinkering away in a code editor.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With that limited programming experience and an eagerness to learn in hand, 
        I was offered a position helping out at a local software company,&nbsp;
        <a href='https://www.leumtech.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Leum Technologies</a>. 
        In this new position, I was motivated to learn new things such as web development, 
        API architecture, and mobile development.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        After graduating from school I made the decision to head straight into the professional workforce. 
        I made the move to Madison, WI and have been working full-time since, starting with a position 
        bootstrapping a taxi management platform at&nbsp;<a href='https://www.mobile22.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Mobile22</a>&nbsp;and
        more recently contributing to front-end systems on&nbsp;<a href='https://www.zendesk.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Zendesk's</a>&nbsp;Growth and Monetization team.
