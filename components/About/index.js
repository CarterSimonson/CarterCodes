      <p>
        My introduction to software development came as a byproduct of my passion for video games as a child.
        It was a goal of mine to learn how the games that I was sinking all of my time into were created.
        This led me to start learning basic Python when I was in middle school.
        I was (and still am) fascinated by the ability to create something cool out of nothing other than time spent tinkering away in a code editor.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With that limited programming experience and an eagerness to learn in hand,
        I was offered a position helping out at a local software company named <a href='https://www.leumtech.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Leum Technologies</a>.
        In this new position, I was motivated to learn new things such as web development, API architecture, and mobile development.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        After graduating high school I decided to head straight into the professional field.
        I made the move to Madison, WI, and have been working full-time ever since - starting with a position building taxi management software
        at <a href='https://www.mobile22.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Mobile22</a> and more recently working as a front-end developer
        on the Growth and Monetization team at <a href='https://www.zendesk.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Zendesk</a>.
