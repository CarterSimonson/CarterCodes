      <p>
        My introduction to software development came as a byproduct of my
        childhood passion for video games. Driven by curiosity, I set out to
        learn how the games I was sinking all my time into were created. I was
        (and still am) fascinated by the ability to create something cool out of
        nothing more than time spent tinkering in a code editor.
        <br />
        <br />
        With that limited programming experience and an eagerness to learn, I
        landed a position at a local software company,{" "}

          Leum Technologies
        </a>
        . This role motivated me to expand my skills, delving into web
        development, API architecture, and mobile development to build software
        for local businesses.

        My career then took me to Madison, WI, where I first helped bootstrap a
        taxi management platform at{" "}

        . More recently, I've been contributing to product onboarding frameworks
        with Zendesk's Growth and Monetization team, where I continue to expand
        my skills in developing and maintaining performant web applications.
